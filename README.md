# Avg_Temp_Analysis
This project utilized daily high and low temperature records from NOAA weather data for Grand Haven, MI. 

The temperature data required some cleaning and tidying as much data was missing, and each row contained two temperature observations, which was corrected by gathering the separate columns "TMAX" and "TMIN" into a single variable as values.

Daily min and max temperatures were grouped by year and month, and the mean for each group was calculated. The monthly means were then plotted, and December averages were marked with points for comparison to this year's December averages.

Horizontal lines were drawn at the most recent December's average max and min temperatures for ease of comparison.

The results indicate that this year's December temperatures were lower than most of the previous 14 years, and not as warm as percieved.

It should be noted that much of the data between August 2016 and August 2018 was missing.
